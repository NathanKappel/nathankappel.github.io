        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Nathan Kappel, I was born in Regina Saskatchewan and moved to Saskatoon when I was only 3. Ever since I was little, I was always a very curious person.
          My parents tell me about all the times where I would not listen to what they told me, because I would just have to go try it for myself before I would believe them.
          I find this funny because still to this day I find myself so interested in so many things, just observing my surroundings and trying to involve myself as much as I
          can is how I handle the curiosity ive had from such a young age. This is just one of the many traits I have that make me the man I am today.

              I have played competitive baseball and football ever since I can remember.
              Sports have played a huge part of my life, helping me understand the true meaning of both teamwork and friendship.
              For baseball I have won three provincial title, attended 3 national championships and two western championships.
              With football, my career ended after high school, I suffered many injuries while playing, so with my health in mind I decided to pursue baseball instead.
              I still find plenty of joy in watching those sports as well, cheering for the Red Sox, Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics.

              Ever since I was old enough to work a job, the lake has been a place for me to unwind and relax.
              My last four summers have consisted of working 50-60 hours monday to friday with the lake acting like the reward at the end of each week.
              I am so lucky and grateful to have friends support this "Work hard, Play hard" kind of life.
              Working hard throughout the week and then spending time away from the city with your closest friends and family is truly how I want to live the rest of my life.

              Technology has always been the topic that intrigues my interest the most.
              Some of the areas that I enjoy learning and reading about are Hardware, AI, Machine learning, Quantum computing, IOT, Security, and Data Science.
              I spend hours each day reading articles on how each of these fields are advancing and changing our day-to-day lives. Some of my favourite books on these topics are
              Life 3.0 Being human in the age of artifical intelligence by Max Tegmark and Permanent Record by Edward Snowden. These writers have had extremely successful careers within
              the industry and by reading there books, My view on technology and the power of it has changed juridically.
